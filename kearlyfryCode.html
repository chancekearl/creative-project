<div class="code-content">
    <div class="code-content-item"><p>I have a wide range of programming skills and capabilities that root in a strong base
        of C++, html, css, and js. I took my first programming class in high school and fell in love with problem solving and creating.
        I would say that those are two of my greatest strengths, along with learning new languages. My favorite part of coding, however,
        is the design. I love finding ways to make websites or ui look and feel good. Although my knowledge is limited I pride myself
        in being able to overcome those challenges. And I am currently working to expand my knowledge.</p></div>
    <div class="code-content-item"><p>I am studying at Brigham Young University learning more about C++ and web
        programming. I will graduate from BYU in 2023 with a BS in Computer Science, and I am also working to get into the animation
        emphasis. Through my classes I hope to develop the skills to work in front end web development/ui design and in the animation
        industry. I plan on learning python and getting into character sim and sfx, using my physics knowledge to make animations feel real
        and flow like they would in real life. I know my journey will take me a lot of places and I am excited to see where it goes.</p></div>
    <div class="code-content-item"><p>Using my knowledge I am confident that I can bring a lot to any workplace. One struggle that
        is kind of unique is that I am colorblind. I have had to learn how to make this weakness a strength, and the more I work
        the more I learn to overcome this challenge, and I am able to use those lessons with every other challenge I have faced.
        People often ask me if getting into animation or design will be more challenging because I am colorblind. The answer is no,
        because I have learned to use it as a strength. In the workplace I know how to get over challenges, and working with a
        team is even better. I know how to set goals and achieve them.</p></div>
